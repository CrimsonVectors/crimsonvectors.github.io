# Hi there, I'm Shouwei Li! 👋

> **Computer Science Student | Visual Storyteller | ENFP 🌻**

I am a Junior Computer Science undergraduate at **Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU)**, currently studying as an exchange student at **Sapienza University of Rome** 🇮🇹.

I stand at the intersection of **Logic** and **Light** — writing clean code by day and capturing cinematic moments by night.
